Extension
========

In the base paper, the author mentioned to use different ML and TL embedding techniques for analysis the datasets for predicting the cyberbullying with original LinearSVC and Logistic Regression, DistiBert, DistiRoBerta and Electra-small from which DistiBert got 97% of accuracy, 

As an extension we applied an ensemble method  combining the predictions of multiple individual models to produce a more robust and accurate final prediction.
However, we can further enhance the performance by exploring other ensemble techniques such as Voting Classifier, LSTM and LSTM + GRU  for analysis Dataset, in which got 99% of accuracy,
With the above As an extension we can build the front end using flask framework for user testing with authentication.
